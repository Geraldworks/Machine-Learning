# Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This is a repository to house my collection of Jupyter Notebooks for all sorts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning adventures. Models created can then be used for subsequent projects whenever necessary. A description of the algorithms used are shown below.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) learn **Feature Maps** that help to identify specific features from a set of training examples. As such, CNNs are widely used for image processing and computer vision algorithms.
